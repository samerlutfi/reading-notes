### Forms:
Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred 
to a printed document that contains 
spaces for you to fill in information.
 **Form Controls:**
 There are several types of form controls that 
you can use to collect information from visitors 
to your site.

* Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
* Each form control is given a name, and the text the 
user types in or the values of the options they select 
are sent to the server.

*  HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it 
easier for visitors to fill in forms.

*  In addition to the CSS properties covered in other 
chapters which work with the contents of all elements, 
there are several others that are specifically used to 
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms
*  List markers can be given different appearances 
using the list-style-type and list-style image 
properties.

*  Table cells can have different borders and spacing in 
different browsers, but there are properties you can 
use to control them and make them more consistent.
*  Forms are easier to use if the form controls are 
vertically aligned using CSS.
-  Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more 
interactive.

> JAVA SCRIPTS EVENTS:

* W hen you browse the web, your browser registers different 
types of events. It's the browser's way of saying, "Hey, this 
just happened." Your script can then respond to these events. 
* Scripts often respond to these events by updating the content of the web page (via the 
Document Object Model) which makes the page feel more interactive. In this chapter, you 
will learn how: 
1-INTERACTIONS CREATE EVENTS

2-EVENTS TRRIGER CODES

3-CODE RESPONSE TO THE USER.

* Events are the browser's way of indicating when 
something has happened (such as when a page has 
finished loading or a button has been clicked).
* Binding is the process of stating which event you are 
waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting 
for that event to happen upon. 

* When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a 
JavaScript function. When this function then changes 
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because 
it has responded to the user. 
* You can use event delegation to monitor for events 
that happen on all of the children of an element.
* The most commonly used events are W3C DOM 
events, although there are others in the HTMLS 
specification as well as browser-specific events.
