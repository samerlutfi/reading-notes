### writing Links:

Links are created using the a element. Users can click on anything 
between the opening a tag and the closing a tag. You specify 
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

* Links are created using the (a) element.

*  The (a) element uses the href attribute to indicate 
the page you are linking to.

*  If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is 
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

*  You can create links to open email programs with an 
email address in the "to" field.

*  You can use the id attribute to target elements within 
a page that can be linked to.

#### Layout:

**LISTS, TABLES AND FORMS:**

-  In addition to the CSS properties covered in other 
chapters which work with the contents of all elements, 
there are several others that are specifically used to 
control the appearance of lists, tables, and forms.

-  List markers can be given different appearances 
using the list-style-type and list-style image 
properties.

-  Table cells can have different borders and spacing in 
different browsers, but there are properties you can 
use to control them and make them more consistent.

-  Forms are easier to use if the form controls are 
vertically aligned using CSS.

-  Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more 
interactive.

**Concepts in Positioning Elements:**
> containing elments such div

>block-level elements such h1 , p ul li

>inline elements such img and b

*  <div> elements are often used as containing elements 
to group together sections of a page.

*  Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you 
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

*  The float property moves content to the left or right 
of the page and can be used to create multi-column 
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)

*  Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.

*  Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, 
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).

*  Grids help create professional and flexible designs.

*  CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.

*  You can include multiple CSS files in one page.

### WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a 
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can 
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). 

* we must declear the function then call it when we need it.

* Functions allow you to group a set of related 
statements together that represent a single task.

* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required 
to do their job) and may return a value. 

**_6 Reasons for Pair Programming:_**

1- Greater efficiency

2- Engaged collaboration

3- Learning from fellow students

4- Social skills

5- Job interview readiness

6- Work environment readiness
