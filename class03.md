## Html lists:
 *  There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, 
unordered, and definition.

*  Ordered lists use numbers.( ol  tag)

* Unordered lists use bullets.(ul  tag)

*  Definition lists are used to define terminology.(d1  dt  dd  tags)

* Lists can be nested inside one another.( li tag)

### boxes:

-  CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.

- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.

-  You can also control the borders, margin and padding 
for each box with CSS.

-  It is possible to hide elements using the display and 
visibility properties.

-  Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and 
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.

-  Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of 
boxes containing text and the leading.

-  CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image 
borders and rounded borders.

**ARRAYS:**
> An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't 
just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

* You should consider using an 
array whenever you are working 
with a list or a set of values that 
are related to each other. 

* Arrays are especially helpful 
when you do not know how 
many items a list will contain 
because, when you create the 
array, you do not need to specify 
how many values it will hold

**CREATING AN ARRAY:**

* _You create an array and give it 
a name just like you would any 
other variable (using the var 
keyword followed by the name of 
the array)._

**switch statemant&loops:**

* switch statements allow you to compare a value 
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default 
option if none match).

* Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 


* All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 

* There are three types of loop: for, while, and 
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
