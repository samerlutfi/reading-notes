To add an image into the page 
you need to use an <img<
element. This is an empty 
element (which means there is 
no closing tag). It must carry the 
following two attributes:
1-**src:**
This tells the browser where 
it can find the image file.
2-**alt:**
This provides a text description 
of the image which describes the 
image if you cannot see it.
>you can also use:**Height and width**

**Where to Place Images 
in Your Code:**
* before or inside or in the middle of paragraph
* we can use **align** left,right,top.....
* **three important rules:**
1-Save images in the right format
2-Save images at the right size
3-Use the correct resolution

>* Use GIF or PNG format 
when saving images 
with few colors or large 
areas of the same color

*  Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or 
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

#### colors:

- **rgb values:**
These express colors in terms 
of how much red, green and 
blue are used to make it up. For 
example: rgb(100,100,90)

- **hex codes:**

These are six-digit codes that 
represent the amount of red, 
green and blue in a color, 
preceded by a pound or hash # 
sign. For example: #ee3e80

- **color names:**

There are 147 predefined color 
names that are recognized 
by browsers. For example: 
DarkCyan
We look at these three different 
ways of specifying colors on the 
next double-page spread.

*  Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps 
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
*  There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: 
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
*  Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
*  It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast 
between any text and the background color (otherwise 
people will not be able to read your content).
*  CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, 
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

### text:

* The **color** property is used to set the color of a text.

* The **direction** property is used to set the text direction.

* The **letter-spacing** property is used to add or subtract space between the letters that make up a word.

* The **word-spacing** property is used to add or subtract space between the words of a sentence.

* The **text-indent** property is used to indent the text of a paragraph.

* The **text-align** property is used to align the text of a document.

* The **text-decoration** property is used to underline, overline, and strikethrough text.

* The **text-transform** property is used to capitalize text or convert text to uppercase or lowercase letters.

* The **white-space property** is used to control the flow and formatting of text.

* The **text-shadow property** is used to set the text shadow around a text.

* There are properties to control the choice of font, size, 
weight, style, and spacing.

*  There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume 
most people will have installed.
*  If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are 
several options, but you need to have the right license 
to use them.

*  You can control the space between lines of text, 
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned 
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be 
indented.

*  You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an 
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or 
when they have visited a link.
